## Advent of Code 2023

All solutions (badly) attempted in Haskell



## Running

Get the inputs for each problem from [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/2023).
As requested by the author, neither the inputs nor the puzzle texts are included in this repository.

Pipe the input into the program. On Windows something like `Get-Content 1.txt | runghc 1.1.hs` for the first problem of the first day.
`<n>.2.hs` solves the second half of the problem for day `n`.
